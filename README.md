# Insurance-Project-numpy-pandas-
A data analysis project that explores various patterns and trends in insurance data using Python. This includes examining relationships between age, BMI, smoking status, region, and insurance charges. Visualizations and statistical summaries provide valuable insights for insurance risk assessment and pricing.



# Insurance Data Analysis Project 🧾📊

This project analyzes a real-world insurance dataset using Python to understand the impact of various factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and more on insurance charges.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

- `age`: Age of the policyholder  
- `sex`: Gender  
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index  
- `children`: Number of dependents  
- `smoker`: Smoking status  
- `region`: Residential region  
- `charges`: Medical insurance cost billed

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the data
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize patterns and correlations
- Identify how features like age, BMI, and smoking affect insurance costs

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations Used

- **Bar Plots** – Mean charges by gender/smoker status
- **Box Plots** – Distribution of charges by region or smoker
- **Count Plots** – Frequency of categorical values like region and smoker
- **Heatmaps** – Feature correlation matrix
- **Scatter Plots** – Age vs. Charges, BMI vs. Charges
- **Histograms** – Distribution of numerical columns
- **KDE Plots** – Smoothed distribution comparison

---

## 📌 Observations

- Smokers are charged significantly more than non-smokers.
- Higher BMI and age correlate with increased charges.
- The number of children does not have a strong impact.
- The Southeast region shows relatively higher average charges.
