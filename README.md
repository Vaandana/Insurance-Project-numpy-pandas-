# Insurance-Project-numpy-pandas-
A data analysis project that explores various patterns and trends in insurance data using Python. This includes examining relationships between age, BMI, smoking status, region, and insurance charges. Visualizations and statistical summaries provide valuable insights for insurance risk assessment and pricing.



# 🧾 Insurance Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes a real-world insurance dataset using Python to explore the impact of various factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and more on insurance charges.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains:

- `age`: Age of the policyholder  
- `sex`: Gender  
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index  
- `children`: Number of dependents  
- `smoker`: Smoking status  
- `region`: Residential region  
- `charges`: Medical insurance cost billed

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess data
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize patterns and relationships
- Identify how age, BMI, and smoking habits affect charges

---

## 📊 Visualizations Used

- **Bar Plots** – Mean charges by gender and smoking status
- **Box Plots** – Charges by region or smoking habit
- **Count Plots** – Frequency of categorical variables
- **Heatmaps** – Feature correlation matrix
- **Scatter Plots** – Age vs. Charges, BMI vs. Charges
- **Histograms** – Distribution of numeric data
- **KDE Plots** – Smoothed comparisons between groups

---

## 📈 Key Observations

- **Smokers** are charged significantly higher than non-smokers.
- Higher **age** and **BMI** lead to increased charges.
- **Children count** does not strongly impact charges.
- **Southeast** region shows relatively higher average charges.
